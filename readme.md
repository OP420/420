# 420
This the very first thing I've ever written in Ruby. It's a simple command line program that displays the time until 4:20

## Installation
You can install 420 by installing the `420-time` gem.

    $ gem install 420-time

## Usage
run `420` from command line to show the time left until the next 4:20.

## Contribute
If you can, please consider helping to translate this gem into as many languages as possible! I wanna see how many languages we can write "Happy 4:20" in! The languages are written in YAML files located in the `lib/local` directory.

## Tests
This is also the first project that I've successfully implemented automated testing. I actually wrote the tests before I wrote most of my code. To my surprise, it sped up my development and reduced the amount of problems I ran into. Testing FTW!

To run tests, run `rake test`

## TODO
Currently 420 is written on thor, but it has only one real task implemented (`time`). I plan to add in a `date` task that will return how many months, weeks, days, hours, and minutes, until April 20th.
