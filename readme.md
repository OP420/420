# 420
This the very first thing I've ever written in Ruby. It's a simple terminal program that displays the time until 4:20

# Contribute
If you can, please consider helping to translate this gem into as many languages as possible! I wanna see how many languages we can write "Happy 4:20" in! The languages are written in YAML files located in the `lib/local` directory.

# Tests
This is also the first project that I've successfully implemented automated testing. I actually wrote the tests before I wrote most of my code. To my surprise, it sped up my development and reduced the amount of problems I ran into. Testing FTW!

To run tests, run `rake test`
